# Turbulent | Frontend Developer Test

This test requires you to build a React component for the following scenario.

We want to display a string of characters which will be split into several lines. Each line can contain a maximum of 80 characters. No word should be broken by an end of line, so it should be moved to the next line.

## Requirements

- ✔️ Receives a string with a variable length as prop
- ✔️ Displays each line of text in its own "div"
- ✔️ No line must exceed 80 characters
- ✔️ No word must be cut by an end of line
- ✔️ Allows reordering the lines using drag and drop
- ✔️ 2 seconds after reordering the elements (debounced), an API call is made with the new
  order as POST body

## Result

### Controls

- `tab` and `shift`+`tab`: Switches the focused item
- `space`: Lifts the focused item or drops it at its current position
- `J` or `arrow up`: Moves the lifted item up one position
- `K` or `arrow down`: Moves the lifted item down one position
- `escape`: Drops the item back to its initial position

### Component `ReorderableText`

<Canvas>
  <Story name="ReorderableText">
    <ReorderableText text="In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat; it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort. " />
  </Story>
</Canvas>
